<h4>02-15-2013 -- DoD Ch. 8-9</h4>

<h5><em>Chapter 8</em></h5>

<p>Brooks sees a dichotomy in software design between what he terms "rationalists" and "empiricists". Provable correctness is attainable in software since just about anything you do in a program maps directly to some mathematical operation. This isn't true for most fields, and software engineers should consider themselves lucky rather than fighting with that fact. We live in the world software empiricists (I don't think empiricism is actually the right word here, more like software by heuristic) have built, and it's buggy and crashes all the time. I think his argument about software proofs being unworkable for anything bigger than a kernel assumes you write a proof about the whole thing at once. Software should be composed of smaller, simple, provably correct pieces. This isn't always possible, but it's not a waste of time either: see the re-emergence of functional programming as concurrent programs become very difficult to reason about.</p>

<h5><em>Chapter 9</em></h5>

<p>Chapter 9 has a pretty simple message: Don't assume everyone is on the same page about design goals. Things shouldn't be implicit, they should be explicit. Even an attempt to make them explicit can even be useful to the design as it sometimes exposes ignorance and faulty assumptions. Moreover, at least everyone is working toward the same goal, correct or not.</p>

<hr />

<h4>02-08-2013 -- DoD Ch. 6-7</h4>

<h5><em>Chapter 6</em></h5>

<p>Chapter 6 is about the move from design by individual to design by teams. He suggests that most great "design" has previously been the product of individuals. He claims that we do team design now primarily to deal with increased complexity and tighter schedules. The challenges this team design bring are around division of labor and keeping the group of collaborators in sync. Everyone must share the same knowledge (training, materials, etc.) to work on the design. He goes on at length about the idea of "conceptual integrity". While collaboration on a design does have some benefits, Brooks thinks that a single person must, in the end, be in charge. His job would be to maintain this "conceptual integrity". He also talks about design reviews, where the team of collaborators meet and and share their work with each other. Brooks is high on two man teams, probably the source of all the "pair programming" methodologies that are popular right now.</p>

<h5><em>Chapter 7</em></h5>

<p>Chapter 7 is about collaboration by workers/designers who aren't in the same room. This is a strange topic to cover in a book since the limits here are mostly technological and change rapidly. There's some talk about how important interfaces/apis/encapsulation are. This is all certainly true, and by now well accepted. Overall, this chapter felt dated despite the 2010 publication date. The videoconferencing tools are much better these days, and some of the limitations he brings up are only a problem if you don't gear your meeting specifically to that medium. I personally think face to face interaction may be overvalued.</p>

<h4>02-02-2013 --DoD Ch. 4-5</h4>

<h5><em>Chapter 4</em></h5>

<p>Chapter four is largely about the requirements part of the design process. Brooks points out problems with the typical process of laying out requirement: that there are usually too many of them and that they aren't prioritized which makes decision making by engineers more difficult. If there are no weightings on requirements and the constraints don't allow for all of them to be satisfied, how do you decide which to satisfy and which to ignore? There should be fewer, more general requirements and there should be some individual who makes the ultimate decisions on them. Unfortunately, the need for work to be done by contract complicates this, and there's no perfect solution despite the suggestion to contract the design and implementation seperately.</p>

<h5><em>Chapter 5</em></h5>

<p>Chapter 5 is about replacing the waterfall model. First Brooks argues that there needs to be a single, teachable model to replace the waterfall. He likes the spiral model, but would like for the interaction between designer and user to be more formally specified as a series of points on the spiral where contracts can be made. He talks a while about open source as a design model, but that is of clearly limited application. You can't open source an electron microscope since building them and using them are two different skillsets and two different groups of people.</p>

<h4>01-28-2013 -- Brooks Video</h4>

<ol>
<li><p><em>00:00 WSOM Design Requirements Workshop .. what is it? what is WSOM? What are “design requirements?:</em></p>

<p> WSOM is the Weatherhead School of Management at Case. Design requirements are a list of requirements that a design must satisfy. They're usually part of a contract with a client. Example: the car must get 45 MPG on the highway.</p></li>
<li><p><em>00:00 Case Western University .. what is it and where is it?</em></p>

<p> Case Western is in Cleveland. It's mostly known for it's medical school and nursing school. Engineering is also strong there. They're also famous for the Michelson Morley experiment which measured the speed of light. I actually went there for two years as a physics major. It's cold.</p></li>
<li><p><em>00:10 someone said “take one out of the bank” .. Collie? Callie? Kalli? Who is this person</em></p>

<p>Probably Kalle Lyytinen, a CWRU faculty member who has published about design requirements.</p></li>
<li><p><em>00:17 “.. award lecture from some seven years ago ” .. what award? who is it named for? who gives the award? why did Brooks receive the award?</em></p>

<p> The Turing award (named after Alan Turing)is given by the ACM and is considered by most to be the "Nobel prize" of CS. Brooks won both for his work at IBM and the writing he's done on software engineering.</p></li>
<li><p><em>00:45 what is this talk about?</em></p>

<p> "the design process"</p></li>
<li><p><em>00:50 “oxford english dictionary” .. what is it? when was it written?</em></p>

<p> The OED is generally considered the authoritative dictionary of the English language. The original version had its last volume published in 1928. There have since been many revisions.</p></li>
<li><p><em>00:51 what is the definition of “design”?</em></p>

<p> Thanks to the UTK Library: <br/>
"a.  (a) To make drawings for the construction or creation of (something, as a building, object, garment, etc.) according to certain aesthetic criteria;  (b) to make plans for the production of (a device, product, etc.) according to structural or functional criteria (sometimes without the implication of aesthetic requirements);  (c) (in extended use) to conceive, devise, plan (something immaterial, as a scheme, system, programme, etc.)."</p></li>
<li><p><em>01:00 “vernacular” .. what does it mean?</em></p>

<p> vernacular is the native or local language of a place</p></li>
<li><p><em>01:02 “odd hoak?” .. what is he saying? what does it mean?</em></p>

<p> something done ad hoc is done quickly and directly for one specific use/purpose. It's not something general or particularly well planned</p></li>
<li><p><em>01:17 “comes from Mozart” .. who is Mozart?</em></p>

<p> Mozart was a composer from the classical period</p></li>
<li><p><em>01:21 “three weeks before an opera was due” .. what opera? what does it sound like?</em></p>

<p>Idomeneo. I've not heard it much, but I know I like Don Giovanni and Figaro better.</p></li>
<li><p><em>01:24 “his father Leopold” .. who was Leopold? what did he do?</em></p>

<p>Leopold was Mozart's father. He was a composer and music teacher. More the latter than the former.</p></li>
<li><p><em>01:29 “due to the duke” .. what duke? duke of where? what is a “duke”? why was an opera due to the duke?</em></p>

<p>According to wikipedia Idomeneo was commissioned by someone named Karl Theodore, the Duke of Bavaria</p></li>
<li><p><em>1:30 what did Mozart tell his father regarding the (design of the) opera?</em></p>

<p>Mozart claimed that it was already composed, he just hadn't written it down yet. This was almost certainly untrue.</p></li>
<li><p><em>2:00 “why study the design process per se” .. what is “per se”? what is a “design process”? why study it?</em></p>

<p>per se means through itself in latin. The design process is the process by which design is done. studying it will hopefully improve design, and make it easier to teach</p></li>
<li><p><em>2:24 “Francis Bacon” .. who is this person? what did he say? what did he do?</em></p>

<p>Sir Francis Bacon was a major proponent of an empirical approach to science, which set him apart from the adherents of the older, more thought experiment based "philosopher" types. Bacon believed in investigation by experiment</p></li>
<li><p><em>02:45 what disciplines have contributed to the theory of design?</em></p>

<p>mechanical engineering, architecture and industrial engineering</p></li>
<li><p><em>3:00 According to Brooks, what is new about design in the 21st century when we compare it to classical design in the 19th century?</em></p>

<p>Modern design is done by teams, not by individuals</p></li>

<li><p><em>04:45 what is exciting about the process of design?</em></p>

<p>According to Brooks, raising the ceiling of practice, which I assume means making better designs possible</p></li>
<li><p><em>5:00 “the sciences of the artificial” .. what is it?</em></p>

<p>desiderata are things you want in your design, desired features/outcomes</p></li>
<li><p><em>5:15 “utility function” .. what is that?</em></p>

<p>I think this is like a fitness function, some way to quantitatively judge the fitness or utility of a design</p></li>
<li><p><em>5:30 “critical budget” .. what is that?</em></p>

<p>This is the most limiting constraint which you balance against your desiderata</p></li>
<li><p><em>6:20 “design tree” .. what is that?</em></p>

<p>The tree that would be formed if you consider each design decision as a branch point with competing final designs at each leaf</p></li>
<li><p><em>6:25 “mono-rooted” .. what is that? what would you call a non-mono-rooted tree?</em></p>

<p>I assume he means that all the possible designs start with a single decision at the top of the tree. A multi-rooted tree?</p></li>
<li><p><em>7:45 “engineer’s model” .. what is it?</em></p>

<p>Depth first search along the design tree to find a maxima for the utility function</p></li>
<li><p><em>8:25 “so much for the straw man” .. what is a straw man? what straw man is he talking about?</em></p>

<p>a straw man is a clearly flawed argument that is falsely attributed to an opponent, usually because his actual argument is harder to find fault with. He's talking about the engineer's model</p></li>
<li><p><em>8:27 “what’s wrong with this model” .. with </em>what<em> model? and what’s actually wrong with it?</em></p>

<p>the engineer's model. It assumes you know the goals up front, which is rarely the case. You also have a huge combinatorial problem trying to evaluate a fitness function at all possible leaves in the design tree</p></li>
<li><p><em>9:15 what’s the hardest thing about designing complex systems?</em></p>

<p>knowing what to design</p></li>
<li><p><em>9:20 “eliciting requirements” .. what is “eliciting”?</em></p>

<p>eliciting is getting something from someone</p></li>
<li><p><em>9:42 “north american aviation” .. who are they? what do they do?</em></p>

<h3>01-27-2013 -- DoD Ch. 1-3</h3>

<h5><em>Chapter 1</em></h5>

<p>In chapter one, Brooks frames the book by giving a few definitions and setting out the major questions he's trying to answer. Design is, informally, the plan of action or "mental formulation" of some thing that needs to be created or implemented. The "design concept" is a little vague, but appears to be a set of very high level desiderata; maybe things like "simplicity." This seems to of use primarily as an organizing principle for communication between designers. The book is primarily about the generality of design approaches across different disciplines, and is focused on what he calls "original design" as opposed to iterations or modifications of existing designs. I'm not sure how much actual work gets done from scratch like that.</p>

<h5><em>Chapter 2</em></h5>

<p>Chapter two is mostly about "The Rational Model," or formal approaches based on things like decision trees or the waterfall approach. These are attempts to provide direction to the design process. As such they are useful, but attempting to use them as a recipe is probably a mistake. The waterfall is too rigid and the problem space is usually too large to tackle with a decision tree.</p>

<h5><em>Chapter 3</em></h5>

<p>Clearly the models from chapter 2 don't really work very well in practice. One problem is the need for formal requirements up front. This is rarely available. Additionally, you can never be sure of the impact of any given design decision until after you've finished. Decisions are inter-related, and those relationships are not always well defined. Constraints can also change during the process. A better approach would take into account the iterative nature of design. There probably isn't an approach that would make everyone happy, but even a flawed system might prove useful.</p>
