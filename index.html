<h4>01-28-2013 -- Brooks Video</h4>

<ol>
<li><p><em>00:00 WSOM Design Requirements Workshop .. what is it? what is WSOM? What are “design requirements?:</em></p>

<p> WSOM is the Weatherhead School of Management at Case. Design requirements are a list of requirements that a design must satisfy. They're usually part of a contract with a client. Example: the car must get 45 MPG on the highway.</p></li>
<li><p><em>00:00 Case Western University .. what is it and where is it?</em></p>

<p> Case Western is in Cleveland. It's mostly known for it's medical school and nursing school. Engineering is also strong there. They're also famous for the Michelson Morley experiment which measured the speed of light. I actually went there for two years as a physics major. It's cold.</p></li>
<li><p><em>00:10 someone said “take one out of the bank” .. Collie? Callie? Kalli? Who is this person</em></p>

<p>Probably Kalle Lyytinen, a CWRU faculty member who has published about design requirements.</p></li>
<li><p><em>00:17 “.. award lecture from some seven years ago ” .. what award? who is it named for? who gives the award? why did Brooks receive the award?</em></p>

<p> The Turing award (named after Alan Turing)is given by the ACM and is considered by most to be the "Nobel prize" of CS. Brooks won both for his work at IBM and the writing he's done on software engineering.</p></li>
<li><p><em>00:45 what is this talk about?</em></p>

<p> "the design process"</p></li>
<li><p><em>00:50 “oxford english dictionary” .. what is it? when was it written?</em></p>

<p> The OED is generally considered the authoritative dictionary of the English language. The original version had its last volume published in 1928. There have since been many revisions.</p></li>
<li><p><em>00:51 what is the definition of “design”?</em></p>

<p> Thanks to the UTK Library: <br/>
"a.  (a) To make drawings for the construction or creation of (something, as a building, object, garment, etc.) according to certain aesthetic criteria;  (b) to make plans for the production of (a device, product, etc.) according to structural or functional criteria (sometimes without the implication of aesthetic requirements);  (c) (in extended use) to conceive, devise, plan (something immaterial, as a scheme, system, programme, etc.)."</p></li>
<li><p><em>01:00 “vernacular” .. what does it mean?</em></p>

<p> vernacular is the native or local language of a place</p></li>
<li><p><em>01:02 “odd hoak?” .. what is he saying? what does it mean?</em></p>

<p> something done ad hoc is done quickly and directly for one specific use/purpose. It's not something general or particularly well planned</p></li>
<li><p><em>01:17 “comes from Mozart” .. who is Mozart?</em></p>

<p> Mozart was a composer from the classical period</p></li>
<li><p><em>01:21 “three weeks before an opera was due” .. what opera? what does it sound like?</em></p>

<p>Idomeneo. I've not heard it much, but I know I like Don Giovanni and Figaro better.</p></li>
<li><p><em>01:24 “his father Leopold” .. who was Leopold? what did he do?</em></p>

<p>Leopold was Mozart's father. He was a composer and music teacher. More the latter than the former.</p></li>
<li><p><em>01:29 “due to the duke” .. what duke? duke of where? what is a “duke”? why was an opera due to the duke?</em></p>

<p>According to wikipedia Idomeneo was commissioned by someone named Karl Theodore, the Duke of Bavaria</p></li>
<li><p><em>1:30 what did Mozart tell his father regarding the (design of the) opera?</em></p>

<p>Mozart claimed that it was already composed, he just hadn't written it down yet. This was almost certainly untrue.</p></li>
<li><p><em>2:00 “why study the design process per se” .. what is “per se”? what is a “design process”? why study it?</em></p>

<p>per se means through itself in latin. The design process is the process by which design is done. studying it will hopefully improve design, and make it easier to teach</p></li>
<li><p><em>2:24 “Francis Bacon” .. who is this person? what did he say? what did he do?</em></p>

<p>Sir Francis Bacon was a major proponent of an empirical approach to science, which set him apart from the adherents of the older, more thought experiment based "philosopher" types. Bacon believed in investigation by experiment</p></li>
<li><p><em>02:45 what disciplines have contributed to the theory of design?</em></p>

<p>mechanical engineering, architecture and industrial engineering</p></li>
<li><p><em>3:00 According to Brooks, what is new about design in the 21st century when we compare it to classical design in the 19th century?</em></p>

<p>Modern design is done by teams, not by individuals</p></li>
<li><p><em>3:40 “ford” .. who is ford? what did he design?</em></p>

<p>Probably Henry Ford, who was the pioneer of the assembly line, or construction of complex things by teams of people by dividing up the labor</p></li>
<li><p><em>3:41 stevenson? stephensen?  .. who is this person? what did he design?</em></p>

<p>Not sure, apparently there was an engineer named stephenson who worked on railways</p></li>
<li><p><em>3:41 “edison?” who is that? what did he design?</em></p>

<p>Probably thomas edison, who designed lots of things</p></li>
<li><p><em>03:46 bruno leshi? bruun aleshi? .. who is this person? what did he design?</em></p>

<p>Brunelleschi was an architect during the renaissance. He designed buildings and ships</p></li>
<li><p><em>3:51 christopher rinn? rynne? .. who is this person? what did he design?</em></p>

<p>Christopher Wren was an 17th century English architect, mostly known for St. Paul's Cathedral</p></li>
<li><p><em>4:29 what is wrong with raising the level of the design practice?</em></p>

<p>Nothing, you make the worst better, thereby improving the average, which is worthwhile</p></li>
<li><p><em>04:45 what is exciting about the process of design?</em></p>

<p>According to Brooks, raising the ceiling of practice, which I assume means making better designs possible</p></li>
<li><p><em>5:00 “the sciences of the artificial” .. what is it?</em></p>

<p>A book by herb simon</p></li>
<li><p><em>5:05 herb simons? .. who is he?</em></p>

<p>He was a professor at CMU. The sciences of the artificial was apparently about developing a scientific process for decision making</p></li>
<li><p><em>5:10 “desiderata” .. what is that?</em></p>

<p>desiderata are things you want in your design, desired features/outcomes</p></li>
<li><p><em>5:15 “utility function” .. what is that?</em></p>

<p>I think this is like a fitness function, some way to quantitatively judge the fitness or utility of a design</p></li>
<li><p><em>5:30 “critical budget” .. what is that?</em></p>

<p>This is the most limiting constraint which you balance against your desiderata</p></li>
<li><p><em>6:20 “design tree” .. what is that?</em></p>

<p>The tree that would be formed if you consider each design decision as a branch point with competing final designs at each leaf</p></li>
<li><p><em>6:25 “mono-rooted” .. what is that? what would you call a non-mono-rooted tree?</em></p>

<p>I assume he means that all the possible designs start with a single decision at the top of the tree. A multi-rooted tree?</p></li>
<li><p><em>7:45 “engineer’s model” .. what is it?</em></p>

<p>Depth first search along the design tree to find a maxima for the utility function</p></li>
<li><p><em>8:25 “so much for the straw man” .. what is a straw man? what straw man is he talking about?</em></p>

<p>a straw man is a clearly flawed argument that is falsely attributed to an opponent, usually because his actual argument is harder to find fault with. He's talking about the engineer's model</p></li>
<li><p><em>8:27 “what’s wrong with this model” .. with </em>what<em> model? and what’s actually wrong with it?</em></p>

<p>the engineer's model. It assumes you know the goals up front, which is rarely the case. You also have a huge combinatorial problem trying to evaluate a fitness function at all possible leaves in the design tree</p></li>
<li><p><em>9:15 what’s the hardest thing about designing complex systems?</em></p>

<p>knowing what to design</p></li>
<li><p><em>9:20 “eliciting requirements” .. what is “eliciting”?</em></p>

<p>eliciting is getting something from someone</p></li>
<li><p><em>9:42 “north american aviation” .. who are they? what do they do?</em></p>

<p>They were an airplace manufacturer. Apparently they are part of Boeing now</p></li>
<li><p><em>9:45 “now part of rockwell” .. who are they? what do they do?</em></p>

<p>They no longer exist, but were a large manufacturing company</p></li>
<li><p><em>0:30 “out of my gored? gord?” .. what is that word? what does it mean?</em></p>

<p>a gourd is a vegetable with a shell. "out of his gourd" is another way of saying crazy or "out of his mind"</p></li>

<h3>01-27-2013 -- DoD Ch. 1-3</h3>

<h5><em>Chapter 1</em></h5>

<p>In chapter one, Brooks frames the book by giving a few definitions and setting out the major questions he's trying to answer. Design is, informally, the plan of action or "mental formulation" of some thing that needs to be created or implemented. The "design concept" is a little vague, but appears to be a set of very high level desiderata; maybe things like "simplicity." This seems to of use primarily as an organizing principle for communication between designers. The book is primarily about the generality of design approaches across different disciplines, and is focused on what he calls "original design" as opposed to iterations or modifications of existing designs. I'm not sure how much actual work gets done from scratch like that.</p>

<h5><em>Chapter 2</em></h5>

<p>Chapter two is mostly about "The Rational Model," or formal approaches based on things like decision trees or the waterfall approach. These are attempts to provide direction to the design process. As such they are useful, but attempting to use them as a recipe is probably a mistake. The waterfall is too rigid and the problem space is usually too large to tackle with a decision tree.</p>

<h5><em>Chapter 3</em></h5>

<p>Clearly the models from chapter 2 don't really work very well in practice. One problem is the need for formal requirements up front. This is rarely available. Additionally, you can never be sure of the impact of any given design decision until after you've finished. Decisions are inter-related, and those relationships are not always well defined. Constraints can also change during the process. A better approach would take into account the iterative nature of design. There probably isn't an approach that would make everyone happy, but even a flawed system might prove useful.</p>
