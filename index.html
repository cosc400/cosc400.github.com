<h5>B</h5>

<p>1.1 Contribute to society and human well-being.</p>

<p>This principle concerning the quality of life of all people affirms an obligation to protect fundamental human rights and to respect the diversity of all cultures. An essential aim of computing professionals is to minimize negative consequences of computing systems, including threats to health and safety. When designing or implementing systems, computing professionals must attempt to ensure that the products of their efforts will be used in socially responsible ways, will meet social needs, and will avoid harmful effects to health and welfare.</p>

<p>In addition to a safe social environment, human well-being includes a safe natural environment. Therefore, computing professionals who design and develop systems must be alert to, and make others aware of, any potential damage to the local or global environment.</p>

<p>1.2 Avoid harm to others.</p>

<p>"Harm" means injury or negative consequences, such as undesirable loss of information, loss of property, property damage, or unwanted environmental impacts. This principle prohibits use of computing technology in ways that result in harm to any of the following: users, the general public, employees, employers. Harmful actions include intentional destruction or modification of files and programs leading to serious loss of resources or unnecessary expenditure of human resources such as the time and effort required to purge systems of "computer viruses."</p>

<p>Well-intended actions, including those that accomplish assigned duties, may lead to harm unexpectedly. In such an event the responsible person or persons are obligated to undo or mitigate the negative consequences as much as possible. One way to avoid unintentional harm is to carefully consider potential impacts on all those affected by decisions made during design and implementation.</p>

<p>To minimize the possibility of indirectly harming others, computing professionals must minimize malfunctions by following generally accepted standards for system design and testing. Furthermore, it is often necessary to assess the social consequences of systems to project the likelihood of any serious harm to others. If system features are misrepresented to users, coworkers, or supervisors, the individual computing professional is responsible for any resulting injury.</p>

<p>In the work environment the computing professional has the additional obligation to report any signs of system dangers that might result in serious personal or social damage. If one's superiors do not act to curtail or mitigate such dangers, it may be necessary to "blow the whistle" to help correct the problem or reduce the risk. However, capricious or misguided reporting of violations can, itself, be harmful. Before reporting violations, all relevant aspects of the incident must be thoroughly assessed. In particular, the assessment of risk and responsibility must be credible. It is suggested that advice be sought from other computing professionals. See principle 2.5 regarding thorough evaluations.</p>

<p>1.3 Be honest and trustworthy.</p>

<p>Honesty is an essential component of trust. Without trust an organization cannot function effectively. The honest computing professional will not make deliberately false or deceptive claims about a system or system design, but will instead provide full disclosure of all pertinent system limitations and problems.</p>

<p>A computer professional has a duty to be honest about his or her own qualifications, and about any circumstances that might lead to conflicts of interest.</p>

<p>Membership in volunteer organizations such as ACM may at times place individuals in situations where their statements or actions could be interpreted as carrying the "weight" of a larger group of professionals. An ACM member will exercise care to not misrepresent ACM or positions and policies of ACM or any ACM units.</p>

<p>1.4 Be fair and take action not to discriminate.</p>

<p>The values of equality, tolerance, respect for others, and the principles of equal justice govern this imperative. Discrimination on the basis of race, sex, religion, age, disability, national origin, or other such factors is an explicit violation of ACM policy and will not be tolerated.</p>

<p>Inequities between different groups of people may result from the use or misuse of information and technology. In a fair society,all individuals would have equal opportunity to participate in, or benefit from, the use of computer resources regardless of race, sex, religion, age, disability, national origin or other such similar factors. However, these ideals do not justify unauthorized use of computer resources nor do they provide an adequate basis for violation of any other ethical imperatives of this code.</p>

<p>1.5 Honor property rights including copyrights and patent.</p>

<p>Violation of copyrights, patents, trade secrets and the terms of license agreements is prohibited by law in most circumstances. Even when software is not so protected, such violations are contrary to professional behavior. Copies of software should be made only with proper authorization. Unauthorized duplication of materials must not be condoned.</p>

<p>1.6 Give proper credit for intellectual property.</p>

<p>Computing professionals are obligated to protect the integrity of intellectual property. Specifically, one must not take credit for other's ideas or work, even in cases where the work has not been explicitly protected by copyright, patent, etc.</p>

<p>1.7 Respect the privacy of others.</p>

<p>Computing and communication technology enables the collection and exchange of personal information on a scale unprecedented in the history of civilization. Thus there is increased potential for violating the privacy of individuals and groups. It is the responsibility of professionals to maintain the privacy and integrity of data describing individuals. This includes taking precautions to ensure the accuracy of data, as well as protecting it from unauthorized access or accidental disclosure to inappropriate individuals. Furthermore, procedures must be established to allow individuals to review their records and correct inaccuracies.</p>

<p>This imperative implies that only the necessary amount of personal information be collected in a system, that retention and disposal periods for that information be clearly defined and enforced, and that personal information gathered for a specific purpose not be used for other purposes without consent of the individual(s). These principles apply to electronic communications, including electronic mail, and prohibit procedures that capture or monitor electronic user data, including messages,without the permission of users or bona fide authorization related to system operation and maintenance. User data observed during the normal duties of system operation and maintenance must be treated with strictest confidentiality, except in cases where it is evidence for the violation of law, organizational regulations, or this Code. In these cases, the nature or contents of that information must be disclosed only to proper authorities.</p>

<p>1.8 Honor confidentiality.</p>

<p>The principle of honesty extends to issues of confidentiality of information whenever one has made an explicit promise to honor confidentiality or, implicitly, when private information not directly related to the performance of one's duties becomes available. The ethical concern is to respect all obligations of confidentiality to employers, clients, and users unless discharged from such obligations by requirements of the law or other principles of this Code.</p>

<p>2.1 Strive to achieve the highest quality, effectiveness and dignity in both the process and products of professional work.</p>

<p>Excellence is perhaps the most important obligation of a professional. The computing professional must strive to achieve quality and to be cognizant of the serious negative consequences that may result from poor quality in a system.</p>

<p>2.2 Acquire and maintain professional competence.</p>

<p>Excellence depends on individuals who take responsibility for acquiring and maintaining professional competence. A professional must participate in setting standards for appropriate levels of competence, and strive to achieve those standards. Upgrading technical knowledge and competence can be achieved in several ways:doing independent study; attending seminars, conferences, or courses; and being involved in professional organizations.</p>

<p>2.3 Know and respect existing laws pertaining to professional work.</p>

<p>ACM members must obey existing local, state,province, national, and international laws unless there is a compelling ethical basis not to do so. Policies and procedures of the organizations in which one participates must also be obeyed. But compliance must be balanced with the recognition that sometimes existing laws and rules may be immoral or inappropriate and, therefore, must be challenged. Violation of a law or regulation may be ethical when that law or rule has inadequate moral basis or when it conflicts with another law judged to be more important. If one decides to violate a law or rule because it is viewed as unethical, or for any other reason, one must fully accept responsibility for one's actions and for the consequences.</p>

<p>2.4 Accept and provide appropriate professional review.</p>

<p>Quality professional work, especially in the computing profession, depends on professional reviewing and critiquing. Whenever appropriate, individual members should seek and utilize peer review as well as provide critical review of the work of others.</p>

<p>2.5 Give comprehensive and thorough evaluations of computer systems and their impacts, including analysis of possible risks.</p>

<p>Computer professionals must strive to be perceptive, thorough, and objective when evaluating, recommending, and presenting system descriptions and alternatives. Computer professionals are in a position of special trust, and therefore have a special responsibility to provide objective, credible evaluations to employers, clients, users, and the public. When providing evaluations the professional must also identify any relevant conflicts of interest, as stated in imperative 1.3.</p>

<p>As noted in the discussion of principle 1.2 on avoiding harm, any signs of danger from systems must be reported to those who have opportunity and/or responsibility to resolve them. See the guidelines for imperative 1.2 for more details concerning harm,including the reporting of professional violations.</p>

<p>2.6 Honor contracts, agreements, and assigned responsibilities.</p>

<p>Honoring one's commitments is a matter of integrity and honesty. For the computer professional this includes ensuring that system elements perform as intended. Also, when one contracts for work with another party, one has an obligation to keep that party properly informed about progress toward completing that work.</p>

<p>A computing professional has a responsibility to request a change in any assignment that he or she feels cannot be completed as defined. Only after serious consideration and with full disclosure of risks and concerns to the employer or client, should one accept the assignment. The major underlying principle here is the obligation to accept personal accountability for professional work. On some occasions other ethical principles may take greater priority.</p>

<p>A judgment that a specific assignment should not be performed may not be accepted. Having clearly identified one's concerns and reasons for that judgment, but failing to procure a change in that assignment, one may yet be obligated, by contract or by law, to proceed as directed. The computing professional's ethical judgment should be the final guide in deciding whether or not to proceed. Regardless of the decision, one must accept the responsibility for the consequences.</p>

<p>However, performing assignments "against one's own judgment" does not relieve the professional of responsibility for any negative consequences.</p>

<p>2.7 Improve public understanding of computing and its consequences.</p>

<p>Computing professionals have a responsibility to share technical knowledge with the public by encouraging understanding of computing, including the impacts of computer systems and their limitations. This imperative implies an obligation to counter any false views related to computing.</p>

<p>2.8 Access computing and communication resources only when authorized to do so.</p>

<p>Theft or destruction of tangible and electronic property is prohibited by imperative 1.2 - "Avoid harm to others." Trespassing and unauthorized use of a computer or communication system is addressed by this imperative. Trespassing includes accessing communication networks and computer systems, or accounts and/or files associated with those systems, without explicit authorization to do so. Individuals and organizations have the right to restrict access to their systems so long as they do not violate the discrimination principle (see 1.4). No one should enter or use another's computer system, software, or data files without permission. One must always have appropriate approval before using system resources, including communication ports, file space, other system peripherals, and computer time.</p>

<p>3.1 Articulate social responsibilities of members of an organizational unit and encourage full acceptance of those responsibilities.</p>

<p>Because organizations of all kinds have impacts on the public, they must accept responsibilities to society. Organizational procedures and attitudes oriented toward quality and the welfare of society will reduce harm to members of the public, thereby serving public interest and fulfilling social responsibility. Therefore,organizational leaders must encourage full participation in meeting social responsibilities as well as quality performance.</p>

<p>3.2 Manage personnel and resources to design and build information systems that enhance the quality of working life.</p>

<p>Organizational leaders are responsible for ensuring that computer systems enhance, not degrade, the quality of working life. When implementing a computer system, organizations must consider the personal and professional development, physical safety, and human dignity of all workers. Appropriate human-computer ergonomic standards should be considered in system design and in the workplace.</p>

<p>3.3 Acknowledge and support proper and authorized uses of an organization's computing and communication resources.</p>

<p>Because computer systems can become tools to harm as well as to benefit an organization, the leadership has the responsibility to clearly define appropriate and inappropriate uses of organizational computing resources. While the number and scope of such rules should be minimal, they should be fully enforced when established.</p>

<p>3.4 Ensure that users and those who will be affected by a system have their needs clearly articulated during the assessment and design of requirements; later the system must be validated to meet requirements.</p>

<p>Current system users, potential users and other persons whose lives may be affected by a system must have their needs assessed and incorporated in the statement of requirements. System validation should ensure compliance with those requirements.</p>

<p>3.5 Articulate and support policies that protect the dignity of users and others affected by a computing system.</p>

<p>Designing or implementing systems that deliberately or inadvertently demean individuals or groups is ethically unacceptable. Computer professionals who are in decision making positions should verify that systems are designed and implemented to protect personal privacy and enhance personal dignity.</p>

<p>3.6 Create opportunities for members of the organization to learn the principles and limitations of computer systems.</p>

<p>This complements the imperative on public understanding (2.7). Educational opportunities are essential to facilitate optimal participation of all organizational members. Opportunities must be available to all members to help them improve their knowledge and skills in computing, including courses that familiarize them with the consequences and limitations of particular types of systems.In particular, professionals must be made aware of the dangers of building systems around oversimplified models, the improbability of anticipating and designing for every possible operating condition, and other issues related to the complexity of this profession.</p>

<p>4.1 Uphold and promote the principles of this Code.</p>

<p>The future of the computing profession depends on both technical and ethical excellence. Not only is it important for ACM computing professionals to adhere to the principles expressed in this Code, each member should encourage and support adherence by other members.</p>

<p>4.2 Treat violations of this code as inconsistent with membership in the ACM.</p>

<p>Adherence of professionals to a code of ethics is largely a voluntary matter. However, if a member does not follow this code by engaging in gross misconduct, membership in ACM may be terminated.</p>

<h5>C</h5>

<p>A conflict of interest is any situation where someone who is tasked with upholding one interest has a second interest that directly conflicts with the first. For example, a criminal court judge is tasked with upholding the law. Similarly, a judge has an interest in not having their close family go to jail. Therefore, the judge should not be involved in cases involving family since those two interests may conflict. Otherwise, he might be tempted to change the outcome of the trial in order to help that family member.</p>

<h5>D</h5>

<p>The ACM code limits its protections to a specific group of people: "This principle prohibits use of computing technology in ways that result in harm to any of the following: users, the general public, employees, employers." This pretty clearly doesn't include criminals or enemy combatants.</p>

<p>The IEEE code specifically refers to injury by "false or malicious action." The use of "malicious" clearly exempts legal actions like war. "Malice" has a legal definition.</p>

<h4>03-21-2013 DoD. Ch. 17-18</h4>

<h5><em>Chapter 17</em></h5>

<p>Brooks starts off this chapter proposing to design a system for architectural design. It should start with a complete design and then modify it to fit what the designer wants. A good set of initial exemplats is important. Brooks goes into detail on the interface… voice command, nouns, verbs and adverbs, 3d vs. 2d, etc. He talks for a while about the system for moving the viewpoint aroudn when visualizing the design.</p>

<h5><em>Chapter 18</em></h5>

<p>Chapter 18 focuses on the architecture system's visualization options. The focus is on visual representation, with multiple monitors. While 2d display is easiest to work with and 2d objects are easiesto manipulate, a 3d representation is important. It's aso important to have text specifications easily viewable/available. Brooks believes his system is buildable now, incrementally.</p>

<hr />

<h4>03-11-2013 DoD. Ch. 15-16</h4>

<h5><em>Chapter 15</em></h5>

<p>If the something is being designed for someone else to use, the person making that thing should talk to the person who will be using it. Ideally, users should be able to shape the product while it's being designed.</p>

<h5><em>Chapter 16</em></h5>

<p>Processes are difficult to document. It's hard to force a lot of concurrent and/or interrelated things into a single linear, sequential narrative. Brooks seems to want to put the entire "decision tree" into writing. He talks a bit about trying to keep decisions independent from each other, and how he saw it as an issue while documenting his house project. Then he talks for a while about some software tools for doing this documentation that he has used.</p>

<hr />

<h4>03-01-2013 DoD Ch. 13-14</h4>

<h5><em>Chapter 13</em></h5>

<p>Designs are usually influenced by some earlier example. Sometimes they are just new features added onto older designs. Brooks seems to like design patterns. He also says that there is more to be learned from the challenges facing earlier designers and their approach to them than their actual designs/solutions. Brooks thinks that careful cataloging and critique of earlier designs would be useful.</p>

<h5><em>Chapter 14</em></h5>

<p>Blind faith in received wisdom is bad. Apparently JCL was a bad language. It was designed too narrowly because the designers mispredicted what people would be doing with it.</p>

<hr />

<h4>02-20-2013 -- DoD Ch. 11-12</h4>

<h5><em>Chapter 11</em></h5>

<p>Constraints are part of what drive design. Contraints should be current, and accurately understood. They can make design easier by narrowing the solution space… General designs carry fewer constraints and therefore more options and complexity.</p>

<h5><em>Chapter 12</em></h5>

<p>Chapter twelve is about design aesthetics. Brooks believes an aesthetically pleasing design combines simplicity with power. He thinks you should be able to see some basic structure and guiding principles in the design. He goes on to talk about his version of the
'principle of least surprise'. The design should be self consistent. It should also be both modular and general. He then goes on for a while about consistency on details making design easier. The way to achieve that consistency is through documentation.</p>

<hr />

<h4>02-18-2013 -- DoD Ch. 10</h4>

<h5><em>Chapter 10</em></h5>

<p>Chapter 10 is about constraints. Brooks points out that money isn't always the only constraint on a project, others can be governed by the available technology, and are thus changing. Constraints should be laid out explicitly early on and managed tightly by one person. Establishing the right constraints can have a strong impact on a design.</p>

<hr />

<h4>02-15-2013 -- DoD Ch. 8-9</h4>

<h5><em>Chapter 8</em></h5>

<p>Brooks sees a dichotomy in software design between what he terms "rationalists" and "empiricists". Provable correctness is attainable in software since just about anything you do in a program maps directly to some mathematical operation. This isn't true for most fields, and software engineers should consider themselves lucky rather than fighting with that fact. We live in the world software empiricists (I don't think empiricism is actually the right word here, more like software by heuristic) have built, and it's buggy and crashes all the time. I think his argument about software proofs being unworkable for anything bigger than a kernel assumes you write a proof about the whole thing at once. Software should be composed of smaller, simple, provably correct pieces. This isn't always possible, but it's not a waste of time either: see the re-emergence of functional programming as concurrent programs become very difficult to reason about.</p>

<h5><em>Chapter 9</em></h5>

<p>Chapter 9 has a pretty simple message: Don't assume everyone is on the same page about design goals. Things shouldn't be implicit, they should be explicit. Even an attempt to make them explicit can even be useful to the design as it sometimes exposes ignorance and faulty assumptions. Moreover, at least everyone is working toward the same goal, correct or not.</p>

<hr />

<h4>02-08-2013 -- DoD Ch. 6-7</h4>

<h5><em>Chapter 6</em></h5>

<p>Chapter 6 is about the move from design by individual to design by teams. He suggests that most great "design" has previously been the product of individuals. He claims that we do team design now primarily to deal with increased complexity and tighter schedules. The challenges this team design bring are around division of labor and keeping the group of collaborators in sync. Everyone must share the same knowledge (training, materials, etc.) to work on the design. He goes on at length about the idea of "conceptual integrity". While collaboration on a design does have some benefits, Brooks thinks that a single person must, in the end, be in charge. His job would be to maintain this "conceptual integrity". He also talks about design reviews, where the team of collaborators meet and and share their work with each other. Brooks is high on two man teams, probably the source of all the "pair programming" methodologies that are popular right now.</p>

<h5><em>Chapter 7</em></h5>

<p>Chapter 7 is about collaboration by workers/designers who aren't in the same room. This is a strange topic to cover in a book since the limits here are mostly technological and change rapidly. There's some talk about how important interfaces/apis/encapsulation are. This is all certainly true, and by now well accepted. Overall, this chapter felt dated despite the 2010 publication date. The videoconferencing tools are much better these days, and some of the limitations he brings up are only a problem if you don't gear your meeting specifically to that medium. I personally think face to face interaction may be overvalued.</p>

<h4>02-02-2013 --DoD Ch. 4-5</h4>

<h5><em>Chapter 4</em></h5>

<p>Chapter four is largely about the requirements part of the design process. Brooks points out problems with the typical process of laying out requirement: that there are usually too many of them and that they aren't prioritized which makes decision making by engineers more difficult. If there are no weightings on requirements and the constraints don't allow for all of them to be satisfied, how do you decide which to satisfy and which to ignore? There should be fewer, more general requirements and there should be some individual who makes the ultimate decisions on them. Unfortunately, the need for work to be done by contract complicates this, and there's no perfect solution despite the suggestion to contract the design and implementation seperately.</p>

<h5><em>Chapter 5</em></h5>

<p>Chapter 5 is about replacing the waterfall model. First Brooks argues that there needs to be a single, teachable model to replace the waterfall. He likes the spiral model, but would like for the interaction between designer and user to be more formally specified as a series of points on the spiral where contracts can be made. He talks a while about open source as a design model, but that is of clearly limited application. You can't open source an electron microscope since building them and using them are two different skillsets and two different groups of people.</p>

<p> WSOM is the Weatherhead School of Management at Case. Design requirements are a list of requirements that a design must satisfy. They're usually part of a contract with a client. Example: the car must get 45 MPG on the highway.</p></li>
<li><p><em>00:00 Case Western University .. what is it and where is it?</em></p>

<p> Case Western is in Cleveland. It's mostly known for it's medical school and nursing school. Engineering is also strong there. They're also famous for the Michelson Morley experiment which measured the speed of light. I actually went there for two years as a physics major. It's cold.</p></li>
<li><p><em>00:10 someone said “take one out of the bank” .. Collie? Callie? Kalli? Who is this person</em></p>

<p> "the design process"</p></li>
<li><p><em>00:50 “oxford english dictionary” .. what is it? when was it written?</em></p>

<li><p><em>00:51 what is the definition of “design”?</em></p>

<p> Thanks to the UTK Library: <br/>
"a.  (a) To make drawings for the construction or creation of (something, as a building, object, garment, etc.) according to certain aesthetic criteria;  (b) to make plans for the production of (a device, product, etc.) according to structural or functional criteria (sometimes without the implication of aesthetic requirements);  (c) (in extended use) to conceive, devise, plan (something immaterial, as a scheme, system, programme, etc.)."</p></li>

<p> vernacular is the native or local language of a place</p></li>
<li><p><em>01:02 “odd hoak?” .. what is he saying? what does it mean?</em></p>

<p> something done ad hoc is done quickly and directly for one specific use/purpose. It's not something general or particularly well planned</p></li>
<li><p><em>01:17 “comes from Mozart” .. who is Mozart?</em></p>

<p> Mozart was a composer from the classical period</p></li>
<li><p><em>01:21 “three weeks before an opera was due” .. what opera? what does it sound like?</em></p>

<p>According to wikipedia Idomeneo was commissioned by someone named Karl Theodore, the Duke of Bavaria</p></li>
<li><p><em>1:30 what did Mozart tell his father regarding the (design of the) opera?</em></p>

<p>Mozart claimed that it was already composed, he just hadn't written it down yet. This was almost certainly untrue.</p></li>
<li><p><em>2:00 “why study the design process per se” .. what is “per se”? what is a “design process”? why study it?</em></p>

<p>per se means through itself in latin. The design process is the process by which design is done. studying it will hopefully improve design, and make it easier to teach</p></li>

<h3>01-27-2013 -- DoD Ch. 1-3</h3>

<h5><em>Chapter 1</em></h5>

<p>In chapter one, Brooks frames the book by giving a few definitions and setting out the major questions he's trying to answer. Design is, informally, the plan of action or "mental formulation" of some thing that needs to be created or implemented. The "design concept" is a little vague, but appears to be a set of very high level desiderata; maybe things like "simplicity." This seems to of use primarily as an organizing principle for communication between designers. The book is primarily about the generality of design approaches across different disciplines, and is focused on what he calls "original design" as opposed to iterations or modifications of existing designs. I'm not sure how much actual work gets done from scratch like that.</p>

<h5><em>Chapter 2</em></h5>

<p>Chapter two is mostly about "The Rational Model," or formal approaches based on things like decision trees or the waterfall approach. These are attempts to provide direction to the design process. As such they are useful, but attempting to use them as a recipe is probably a mistake. The waterfall is too rigid and the problem space is usually too large to tackle with a decision tree.</p>

<h5><em>Chapter 3</em></h5>

<p>Clearly the models from chapter 2 don't really work very well in practice. One problem is the need for formal requirements up front. This is rarely available. Additionally, you can never be sure of the impact of any given design decision until after you've finished. Decisions are inter-related, and those relationships are not always well defined. Constraints can also change during the process. A better approach would take into account the iterative nature of design. There probably isn't an approach that would make everyone happy, but even a flawed system might prove useful.</p>
